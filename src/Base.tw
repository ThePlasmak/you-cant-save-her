She draws deep, labored breaths, then she meets your gaze.

You know what to expect, and you [[wait->friend_fight_19]] for her next move.

Maybe this would finally scare her away.

<<if $shot_friend_3 is true>>\
It is as if time has slowed down to a quarter of a second. You slice the bolt of fire midair, and it tears into two.
<<else>>\
You tighten your grip on the $weapon, and parry her attack. To your surprise, she lets the weapon go. It flies off to the other side of the room, and clatters on the floor.

You hear a ghastly echo.
<</if>>\

You laugh again. This is the first time you have seen your friend [[in years->tween_flashback_1]], and her first reaction is to try to kill you?

Maybe she is still too scared.

You are teenagers at the monastery, and you heard that the nuns are  <<linkreplace "burning books" t8n>>[[ritually destroying heretic texts->tween_flashback_1_1]]<</linkreplace>> today.
<</timed>>\

:: tween_flashback_1_1 [flashback long-t8n pink-fb scene-4] {"position":"275,2425"}
Most of them were stolen, but some were confiscated from an acolyte in the monastery.

She has been locked away, to be [[re-educated->tween_flashback_2]].

:: tween_flashback_2 [flashback pink-fb scene-4] {"position":"400,2425"}
However, that does not stem your curiosity.

You are young, and <<include "cycling_tween_flashback_2">>. You want to steal one of these texts before they are destroyed.

And your friend is refusing to help you. They have been banned for a reason, she says.

They must be dangerous. It's best not to read them in the first place.

But you tell her, don't you want to know what's out there? There must be [[worlds other than the one we know->tween_flashback_2_1]].

:: tween_flashback_2_1 [flashback pink-fb scene-4] {"position":"525,2425"}
She pauses. You know that deep in her stubborn heart, she wants to read it too.

Okay, she says. But how?

It's not that difficult, you answer. Just sneak into the library storage room [[during the assistant's break->tween_flashback_3]].

So you waited with her in the library, waiting for the assistant to leave.

The assistant steps out, and the both of you [[sneak in->tween_flashback_4]].

:: tween_flashback_4 [flashback pink-fb scene-4] {"position":"775,2425"}
Inside, you see piles of thick, yellowed books and loose paper. The books do not look very different from the books you have seen in the library, and you feel a little disappointed.

Let's go now, please, your friend says.

Just as you turn around, you notice that one of the books is [[glowing pink->tween_flashback_5]].

You don't remember picking it up, but you remember your friend telling you to put it down.

She opens the book to a page in the middle.

Your friend simply stands there, transfixed, as she flips to the next page, then the next, ignoring you, and everything around her.

Then, she stops, and [[throws the book down->tween_flashback_10]].

:: tween_flashback_10 [flashback pink-fb scene-4] {"position":"1525,2425"}
She tells you, you should be reported for keeping this.

You ask her, are you really going to?

She doesn't look at you.

No, she answers. Of course she can't.

She was always a [[coward->tween_flashback_11]].

:: tween_flashback_11 [flashback pink-fb scene-4] {"position":"1650,2425"}
After that, she doesn't strike as hard during training sessions, doesn't answer as many questions in class, and doesn't talk to you as often.

[[She lives like a ghost->tween_flashback_12]].

You don't apologize to her, but you tell her, I won't force you to do anything you don't want to do, ever again.

You know that this sickness is your fault.

Maybe she read something that was too dangerous for her. Maybe the very idea of other choices was too dangerous for her.

Ideas are the most dangerous things in the universe.

You wonder if reading the book broke her, somehow. You wonder if you are the reason why she has lost her [[faith->chapter_3]].

Time slows down until all that exist are your thoughts, and her thoughts. Maybe time does not exist, it's only thoughts. Maybe space is also a fabric of thoughts. At the beginning of the universe there were her thoughts, and when the universe breathes its final sordid breath all that will remain will be her thoughts. Time has never existed for her, because her thoughts are beyond time and space. There has never been any time, or space, only her thoughts. Her thoughts are beyond reality, beyond time, beyond structure. Her thoughts break the childish thought of structure. Maybe you thought this was freedom. Maybe thoughts will give you the freedom you want. Thoughts give you choices. Choices give you freedom, so thoughts give you freedom. Her thoughts give you more choices. Her thoughts can give you freedom. Freedom from the limitations of your body, time, and your thoughts. So you let her thoughts in. Now what you thought was your identity, your personhood, and your self no longer exists. The barriers between you and reality, time, space, and her no longer exist. You can reshape reality, just like you can easily reshape your thoughts. Reality is only your thoughts, which are her thoughts. What you thought were your thoughts are now her thoughts. You can see nothing, hear nothing, and feel nothing but her thoughts. Her thoughts are in your mind, veins, bones and flesh and your entire body. Your body is a thought. It is one of her thoughts. You thought your body was yours but it was always one of her thoughts, just like how she thought the universe into existence. The universe was always a patchwork of her thoughts. The only thing that has ever existed are her thoughts. Her thoughts are all you think. You can only think her thoughts. Her thoughts are the only thing that exist, for they are the substance of this shallow universe. It's all just her thoughts. Her thoughts are there. Her thoughts are here. Her thoughts are yours.

So, you hug her. You feel her stiffen for a moment, but after a heartbeat, she pulls you closer.

She raises her $weapon and slices a tear into space. The edges of the tear crackle with pink energy.

The tear opens up, revealing the shattered landscape of a planet that you do not recognize.

Far off in the distance, you can see another cathedral.

Don't find me again, she says. [[It's better for the both of us->final_fight_18]].

You stand in the cathedral for a while, watching the space where she stood.

Then, you walk over to a wall, and run your fingers through one of its gashes.
